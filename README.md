## Installation

#### Step-1
First download an useless theme from the vscode extension that you don't use normally.

#### Step-2
Then open the extension folder of vscode following this path
`c:\Users\Alex\.vscode\extensions`

Here you will find all the extension list you've installed on your pc. Now find the recently installed useless theme extension on that list and open the folder. 

#### Step-3

Inside this extension folder you will find the `.json` file(s) of the available theme(s) in the extension. 
If you can't find it directly there might be a `dist` folder and here you can definately find the `.json` file.

#### Step-4

Now open the `.json` file in vscode by double-clicking on it. You may find multiple `.json` files if the extension containes more than one themes. _So just select any one of them and remember its name_

#### Step-5 
Now replace the whole `.json` code with the code of `early-morning.json` and save the file.

#### Step-6
Restart your vscode, then go to the settings like this
`manage -> theme -> color theme`, then select the theme you have just edited. _Now Enjoy!!!_

#### Handle Error
If your theme doesn't change as wanted, then you might have made some mistakes during following the steps. Plese try to follow the steps properly.
